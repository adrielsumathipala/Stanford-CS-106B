# Stanford-CS-106B

Assignments from Stanford's **CS106B Programming Abstractions**. Taught in C++, this course covers the foundation of modern computer science from efficient algorithms to recursion to abstract data types.
While interning in the summer, I worked on this course in my free time to supplement similar coursework at Yale, strengthen my programming skills, and deepen my understanding of CS fundamentals.

This repository includes assignments from the course. These C++ programs can be compiled and run using Qt Creator. See Stanford's CS 106B instructions  [here](http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1186//handouts/qt-creator.html) for more information on installing and configuring Qt Creator.

* **Assignment 1, Game of Life**: A game modeling the life cycle of bacteria as invented by British mathematician J. H. Conway.

* **Assignment 2 (Part A), Word Ladder**: This program calculates the shortest distance between two words using breadth-first search. Implemented using **stacks and queues**.

* **Assignment 2 (Part B), Ngrams**: This program takes in a text file and then randomly generates new text in a similar style using a hidden Markov model. Implemented using **maps**.
